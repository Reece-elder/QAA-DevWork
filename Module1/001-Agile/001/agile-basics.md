Agile Values

Agile and all of its methodologies work against 4 core values in software development.

    Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools - ensure that we value the people building a product over standard processes and tools as they are the ones who need to communicate and adapt to changes within a project.

    Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation - extensive documentation takes time away from software development, keep documentation streamlined and simple in order to develop software at the rapid rate needed.

    Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation - work with the customer to make the most valuable product possible rather than creating the bare minimum for a specification.

    Responding to Change over Following a Plan - allow customers to request changes, and embrace those changes within software development
