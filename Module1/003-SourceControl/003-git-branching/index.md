# Tutorial

Diagram software to talk about and explain branches

Feature Branch Model

- Make Dev branch
- switch to Dev
- make 001-feature1
- make 001-feature1.md 
- attempt to push to gitlab (NO REMOTE BRANCH)

git branch  shows all branches
git branch <new name> makes a new branch
git checkout <name> switches to this branch
git checkout -b <new name> makes and switches to this branch
git branch -d <name> deletes a local branch

# Exercise
Make a dev branch and push it to gitlab
Make 3 feature branches off of dev and push them all up to gitlab, each branch should contain a unique file with a unique file extension
! IMPORTANT MAKE SURE YOU SWITCH BACK TO DEV BETWEEN BRANCHES !

Delete local branches
