# Tutorial

Cause a merge conflict
1) In dev make a file called "conflictFile.txt" that contains "Hello World"
2) Branch off of dev, add some text to the file
3) checkout back to dev and add different text to the file
4) commit and push each branch up to github
5) Make a merge request.. merge conflict time!
